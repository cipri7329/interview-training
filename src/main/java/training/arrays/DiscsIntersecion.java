/**
 * Created by cipri on 7/29/16.
 *
 * We draw N discs on a plane.
 * The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. A zero-indexed array A of N non-negative integers,
 * specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given.
 * The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].
 * We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th
 * and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).
